# Autodesk MCP Platform — Editing Tools (Phase 5B–5E)

**Status:** Implemented
**Date:** 2026-08-09 (Phase 5E: `delete_pipe` — full create/update/delete pipe lifecycle)
**Scope:** The production editing commands — `rename_alignment` and `rename_surface`
(Phase 5B), the first *creation* command `create_pipe` with multi-material pipe support
(Phase 5C), `create_pipe_network` (Phase 5C), `update_pipe` (Phase 5D), and `delete_pipe`
(Phase 5E) — exercising the complete write pipeline end-to-end. This document is the standard
reference for all future write operations.

---

## 1. Architecture

Every editing operation flows through the fixed command pipeline; tools never touch Autodesk
transactions:

```text
MCP Tool (CommandToolBase)          Civil3D.Tools.Editing
  → RenameXxxRequest → RenameXxxCommand
CommandDispatcher (validation → permission → confirmation → progress)
  → TransactionPipeline (begin → document lock → handler → commit | rollback)
    → RenameCommandHandler<TCommand> (undo unit)
      → RenameXxxService (business rules + ObjectRenamed event)
        → XxxRenameRepository (Autodesk rename inside the active transaction)
  → protocol response (RenameResult)
```

**Layering rules (non-negotiable):**

- **Tools** contain orchestration only: bind input → command, map result → DTO.
- **Services** contain business rules: existence, no-op detection, uniqueness, event raising.
- **Repositories** contain Autodesk access only: open objects, set names, map outcomes.
- **Handlers** coordinate: open/commit the undo unit, delegate to the service, roll back on failure.
- No tool or handler opens a transaction. The pipeline owns begin/commit/rollback/dispose.

---

## 2. Command Lifecycle

1. `CommandToolBase.CreateCommand` builds the command (capturing the current name via the read
   service so no-op renames are reported clearly).
2. `CommandDispatcher` publishes `CommandStarted`, runs every registered
   `ICommandValidator<TCommand>` (structural name rules), checks permission
   (`ModifyDrawing`) and confirmation (policy-driven).
3. `TransactionPipeline` begins a document-locked write transaction and hands it to the handler
   together with the timeout/cancellation-linked token.
4. `RenameCommandHandler<TCommand>` opens an `IUndoContext` unit, calls the rename service, and
   commits the undo unit on success (rolls it back on failure).
5. The service rejects no-op renames (`InvalidName`) and duplicate names (`DuplicateName`),
   performs the Autodesk rename through the write repository, and raises `ObjectRenamed`.
6. The pipeline commits; the dispatcher publishes `CommandCompleted`/`TransactionCommitted` and
   logs name, ids, execution time, correlation and session. Any failure rolls back and maps to a
   stable protocol error.

---

## 3. Validation Flow

Structural validation runs in the validators **before any transaction**:

- Name is not empty / whitespace.
- Name length ≤ 64 characters.
- Name contains only supported characters (`\w ._()-'`).

Existence, no-op and uniqueness are enforced **inside the write transaction** by the service
(`EntityNotFound`, `InvalidName`, `DuplicateName` domain codes), so the checks are atomic with
the write. Validator failures → `E_VALIDATION_FAILED`; service domain failures map to
`E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND` / `E_VALIDATION_FAILED`.

---

## 4. Transaction & Confirmation

- **Document lock + write transaction** — provided by `AutodeskTransactionProvider`; the
  handler receives `IWriteTransaction` and passes it to the service/repository.
- **Rollback** — any failure (service rule, Autodesk error, timeout, cancellation) aborts the
  transaction, publishes `TransactionRolledBack` with the reason, and rethrows the original
  `DomainException`/`CommandException`.
- **Confirmation** — driven by `BridgeOptions.RequireConfirmationForRename`. When enabled the
  command sets `RequiresConfirmation`; the pipeline denies execution unless
  `IConfirmationGate.IsGranted` returns true (the null gate denies everything until the
  confirmation channel is wired — a safe default).

---

## 5. Repository Responsibilities

- `IAlignmentRenameRepository.Rename(IWriteTransaction, long id, string newName)` casts the
  transaction handle to the Autodesk `Transaction`, opens the object for write, sets `Name`,
  and returns an immutable `RenameOutcome(ObjectId, PreviousName, CurrentName)`.
- Write repositories resolve the active database through `IAutodeskDocumentContext.ExecuteWrite`
  (a dedicated write seam added in Phase 5B — never `ExecuteRead`), so document availability
  and exception mapping are shared with the read path.
- `AutodeskAlignmentRenameRepository` / `AutodeskSurfaceRenameRepository` live in the domain
  discipline projects (where the Autodesk references live) and are registered in the bridge.
- Repositories throw `DomainException` (`EntityNotFound`, `TransactionFailed`) and never leak
  Autodesk exceptions.

## 6. Service Responsibilities

`RenameAlignmentService` / `RenameSurfaceService` (identical shape):

1. `_read.GetById(id)` — existence + current name (`EntityNotFound`).
2. No-op check — same name (case-insensitive) → `InvalidName`.
3. `_read.ExistsName(newName, exceptId: id)` — uniqueness (`DuplicateName`).
4. `_write.Rename(transaction, id, newName)` — the Autodesk rename.
5. Publish `ObjectRenamed` and return `RenameResult`.

Services depend on the read repository (uniqueness), the write repository (rename) and the
`IDomainEventDispatcher` — all constructor-injected, all Autodesk-free.

---

## 7. Events & Undo

- **Events** — `CommandStarted`, `CommandCompleted`, `CommandFailed`,
  `TransactionCommitted`, `TransactionRolledBack` come from the framework; the rename raises
  `ObjectRenamed(ObjectType, ObjectId, PreviousName, NewName, CorrelationId, SessionId)`.
  No subscribers exist yet.
- **Undo** — `RenameCommandHandler` opens an `IUndoContext` unit per rename and commits/rolls
  it back. The abstraction keeps handlers free of AutoCAD undo APIs; the real AutoCAD
  integration lands later without touching handlers. Note: the unit is committed when the
  handler succeeds, just before the pipeline commits the transaction; the future AutoCAD
  implementation must couple the undo record to the transaction commit (rolling the record back
  if the transaction fails to commit).

---

## 8. How to Build a Future Editing Tool

1. **DTOs** — immutable request record + result record in the tool project.
2. **Command** — extend `RenameCommandBase` (or a new base) with a stable `Name`, the payload
   properties and the discipline `ObjectType`; `RequiredPermission`/`IsReadOnly` are inherited.
3. **Validator** — `ICommandValidator<TCommand>` using `NameRules` for structural checks.
4. **Service** — discipline `RenameXxxService : IRenameXxxService` with the read repository
   (uniqueness), the write repository and the event dispatcher.
5. **Write repository** — `IXxxRenameRepository` interface + Autodesk implementation in the
   discipline domain project.
6. **Handler** — reuse `RenameCommandHandler<TCommand>` (or an equivalent thin handler with
   undo).
7. **Tool** — `CommandToolBase<TIn, TOut, TCommand, TResult>` with `[McpTool(...,
   Permission = ToolPermission.ModifyDrawing)]`; auto-discovered, no registration.
8. **DI** — register repository, service, handler and validator in
   `BridgeServiceCollectionExtensions`.
9. **Tests** — follow `Civil3D.Tools.Editing.Tests`: in-memory drawing + fake repositories,
   tool-level pipeline tests and dispatcher integration tests.

## 9. Error Mapping

| Failure | Domain code | Protocol code |
|---|---|---|
| Object missing | `EntityNotFound` | `E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND` |
| Empty / too long / bad characters | validator | `E_VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| No-op rename | `InvalidName` | `E_VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| Duplicate name | `DuplicateName` | `E_VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| Confirmation denied | — | `E_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` |
| Permission | — | `E_PERMISSION_DENIED` |
| Write failure / commit failure | `TransactionFailed` | `E_TRANSACTION_FAILED` |
| Timeout / cancellation | — | `E_TIMEOUT` / `E_CANCELLED` |

Raw Autodesk exceptions never cross the protocol boundary — every failure is translated by
`CommandErrorMapper` and `ReadOnlyRepositoryBase`/the write repository wrappers.

---

## 10. `create_pipe` (Phase 5C)

The first *creation* command — as opposed to rename's in-place edit — follows the same pipeline
shape but does not extend `RenameCommandBase`: `CreatePipeCommand` implements `ICommand<TResult>`
directly, since its payload (network, part match, diameter, start/end geometry) doesn't fit the
rename shape.

```text
MCP Tool (CreatePipeTool)                Civil3D.Tools.Editing
  → CreatePipeRequest → CreatePipeCommand (endpoint computed from start + length + direction)
CommandDispatcher (validation → permission → confirmation → progress)
  → TransactionPipeline (begin → document lock → handler → commit | rollback)
    → CreatePipeCommandHandler (undo unit)
      → ICreatePipeService (network existence + PartCreated event)
        → IPipeCreateRepository (Autodesk part resolution + Network.AddLinePipe)
  → protocol response (CreatePipeResult)
```

**Part resolution** is the operation's one Autodesk-specific step, isolated entirely in
`AutodeskPipeCreateRepository`:

1. Open the target network for write (`Database.GetObjectId` + `Transaction.GetObject`, same
   pattern as the rename repositories).
2. Read the network's `PartsList` and call `GetPartFamilyIdsByDomain(DomainType.Pipe)` to get
   every pipe part family already assigned to it.
3. Match `CreatePipeSpecification.PartFamilyMatch` (case-insensitive substring) against each
   family's `Description`. Zero or more-than-one matches throw `DomainException(PartNotFound, …)`
   listing the available/ambiguous family descriptions — the tool never guesses.
4. Call `Network.AddLinePipe(familyId, sizeId, line, ref newPipeId, applyRules: true)` with any
   size from the matched family as the creation seed.
5. Call `Pipe.ResizeByInnerDiameterOrWidth(diameterMeters, useClosestSize: true)` on the new pipe
   — Civil 3D's own native snapping selects the closest size to the requested diameter, so the
   repository never has to parse catalog size names.

`CreatePipeTool` builds the default `PartFamilyMatch` from the discrete `Material`/`Sdr`/
`PressureClassBar` request fields (for example `HDPE` + `17` + `10` → `"HDPE SDR17 PN10"`) unless
the caller supplies an explicit override.

**Material-aware rating validation.** The domain `PipeMaterials` catalog (the single source of
truth shared with `create_pipe_network`'s family resolution) defines, per material, the catalog
family-description variants and the standard SDR / PN rating sets: HDPE (SDR 11/17/26/32.5,
PN 6/8/10/16), PVC (SDR 26/35/41, PN 6/10/12.5/16), Ductile Iron (PN 10/16/25/40 — pressure
class only, no SDR) and Concrete/RCP (no SDR/PN). `CreatePipeService` rejects ratings that are
not standard for the requested material with `E_VALIDATION_FAILED` — for example SDR on a Ductile
Iron pipe, or SDR 99 on HDPE. Unknown materials skip rating validation (the bare text match still
applies), so custom catalogs are unaffected. Aliases are accepted: `RCP` / `Reinforced Concrete`
resolve to the Concrete family, `DI` to Ductile Iron.

The pipe is always **horizontal**: the tool computes the
end point from `StartEasting`/`StartNorthing` + `LengthMeters` at `DirectionDegrees` (0 =
+Easting axis, counter-clockwise), holding elevation constant — sloped pipes are out of scope for
this command.

The network itself is never created implicitly — `create_pipe` requires an existing network name
(discoverable via `list_pipe_networks`) and fails with `E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND` otherwise, exactly
like rename's `E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND` for a missing alignment/surface id.

| Failure | Domain code | Protocol code |
|---|---|---|
| Network missing | `EntityNotFound` | `E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND` |
| Empty network name / part match / non-positive diameter or length | validator | `E_VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| No / ambiguous pipe part family match | `PartNotFound` | `E_VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| Non-standard SDR/PN for the material (for example SDR on Ductile Iron, SDR 99 on HDPE) | `ValidationFailed` | `E_VALIDATION_FAILED` |

---

## 11. `update_pipe` (Phase 5D)

The in-place counterpart to `create_pipe`: changes an existing pipe's elevation, diameter or
length by its stable numeric id through the same command pipeline. The repository opens the pipe
by handle for write and applies only the requested changes (omitted changes keep the pipe's
current value; at least one change is required):

- **Elevation** — `elevationMeters` moves both endpoints to the given elevation in Z, so the
  pipe stays horizontal at the new elevation.
- **Length** — `lengthMeters` moves the end point along the pipe's current horizontal bearing so
  the center-to-center length becomes the requested value; the start point stays fixed and the
  end elevation is preserved.
- **Diameter** — `diameterMm` re-sizes the pipe via
  `Pipe.ResizeByInnerDiameterOrWidth(..., useClosestSize: true)`, the same native snapping the
  create path uses.

The update runs inside the write transaction (a failure rolls it back atomically) and raises
`PartUpdated`. The pipe id, current geometry, part size and the list of applied changes are read
back inside the transaction and returned in `UpdatePipeResult`, so callers always see the
post-update state.

| Failure | Domain code | Protocol code |
|---|---|---|
| Pipe id not positive | validator | `E_VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| Pipe missing | `EntityNotFound` | `E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND` |
| No change requested (no elevation/diameter/length) | validator | `E_VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| Non-positive diameter / length | validator | `E_VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| Civil 3D rejects the change | `TransactionFailed` | `E_TRANSACTION_FAILED` |

---

## 12. `delete_pipe` (Phase 5E)

The counterpart to `create_pipe`: removes an existing pipe from its network by the stable
numeric id (returned by `create_pipe` or `list_pipe_networks`) through the same command
pipeline. The repository opens the pipe for write, reads its identity back (name, network, part
family and size), and erases it via `Pipe.Erase()` (the Civil 3D `Network` API has no dedicated
delete-pipe method). The deletion happens inside the write transaction, so a later failure rolls
it back atomically. After the command commits, the tool best-effort saves the drawing (reusing
`ISaveDrawingService`) so the deletion persists — a failed save never fails a successful delete.

| Failure | Domain code | Protocol code |
|---|---|---|
| Pipe id not positive | validator | `E_VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| Pipe missing | `EntityNotFound` | `E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND` |
| Civil 3D rejects the erasure | `TransactionFailed` | `E_TRANSACTION_FAILED` |

---

## 13. `create_pipe_network` (Phase 5C)

The network factory: creates a new pipe network plus a parts list seeded with the requested
pipe material families. Materials resolve through the shared `PipeMaterials` catalog (HDPE,
PVC, Ductile Iron, Concrete/RCP, Corrugated HDPE, Corrugated Metal, ...), so a single network
can carry multiple materials. Family sizes default to a sane range per family when the catalog
install omits them. The network and parts list are created inside the write transaction; the
result returns the new network id, its parts list name and the families added/failed.

| Failure | Domain code | Protocol code |
|---|---|---|
| Network name empty / already exists | validator / `DuplicateName` | `E_VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| No materials resolvable from the catalog | `PartNotFound` | `E_VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| Civil 3D rejects the creation | `TransactionFailed` | `E_TRANSACTION_FAILED` |
