# Autodesk.MCP.Server

The production MCP server that exposes the `Civil3D.Bridge` tool catalog to MCP clients.

It is a Node.js 20+ TypeScript application built on the official
`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. It discovers bridge instances from the endpoint registry,
speaks the Autodesk MCP named-pipe JSON-RPC protocol, and registers every discovered tool
dynamically as an MCP tool. **No tool is hardcoded.**

```

## Architecture

The server is layered so that each concern is isolated and individually testable.

| Layer | Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP | `src/mcp/mcpAdapter.ts` | Registers MCP handlers (`tools/list`, `tools/call`, `ping`) on the SDK `Server`; declares `tools.listChanged` and pushes `notifications/tools/list_changed` when the catalog changes; validates arguments; maps bridge envelopes to MCP results; forwards progress and cancellation. |
| MCP | `src/mcp/schema.ts` | Compiles and caches ajv validators from the bridge's JSON Schema per tool. |
| MCP | `src/mcp/errors.ts` | Maps bridge failures to structured `isError` tool results; keeps the bridge error code visible to the AI client. |
| Manager | `src/manager.ts` | Selects the bridge to talk to (product/bridge preferences, recency), owns the reconnect loop with backoff, and re-emits `manifest` / `progress` / `status` events. |
| Bridge | `src/bridge/bridgeClient.ts` | One authenticated session to a bridge: handshake, session id, `tools/list` manifest loading with diff caching, `tools/execute`, `$/cancel`, progress events. |
| Discovery | `src/discovery/endpointStore.ts` | Scans `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AutodeskMcp\endpoints`, parses descriptors, checks pid liveness, cleans stale files, and selects the best endpoint. |
| Discovery | `src/discovery/monitor.ts` | Polls the registry; emits `snapshot` on every poll (drives the manager's state machine) and `update` only when the endpoint set changes (appear / disappear / replace). |
| Transport | `src/transport/bridgeConnection.ts` | One named-pipe session: NDJSON framing, request/response correlation by correlation id, per-request timeouts, heartbeat, cancellation, and rejection of in-flight requests on disconnect. |
| Transport | `src/transport/ndjson.ts` / `pipe.ts` | Newline-delimited JSON framing with size guards; Windows named-pipe path resolution and connection. |
| Protocol | `src/protocol/*` | TypeScript mirrors of the shared wire contracts (`RequestEnvelope`, `ResponseEnvelope`, `Manifest`, `ToolManifest`, `EndpointDescriptor`, ...), method/notification constants, and SemVer helpers. |
| Config / Logging | `src/config.ts`, `src/logger.ts`, `src/index.ts` | Configuration file + environment variables, pino logging to **stderr** (stdout stays clean for MCP), and the stdio entrypoint. |

### Execution path for one `tools/call`

1. The MCP client calls `tools/call { name, arguments }`.
2. `McpAdapter` looks up the tool in the current manifest, strips MCP-reserved control fields (`_meta`, `confirm`) from the arguments, and validates the remainder against the bridge's input schema (ajv). Invalid arguments become a JSON-RPC `InvalidParams` error (`-32602`).
3. A fresh correlation id is created. If the client supplied `_meta.progressToken`, the token is remembered for that correlation so progress can be forwarded back to the right client request.
4. `BridgeClient.execute(toolName, args)` sends `tools/execute` over the named pipe. The bridge envelope is returned whether it is a success or a business failure.
5. Success payloads are serialized as text content; failures become an `isError: true` result whose JSON keeps the bridge error code (`E_...`) so clients can react programmatically. A confirmation-required failure carries `confirmation.retryWith: { confirm: true }`.
6. While the tool runs, bridge `$/progress` notifications are forwarded as MCP `notifications/progress` (with the progress token). Client `notifications/cancelled` aborts the SDK request signal, which forwards `$/cancel` to the bridge.

## Bridge discovery

Bridges publish a JSON descriptor file into the endpoint registry:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\AutodeskMcp\endpoints\<product>-<pid>.json
```

Example descriptor (`EndpointDescriptor`):

```json
{
  "bridgeName": "Civil3D.Bridge",
  "product": "Civil3D",
  "productVersion": "2026",
  "bridgeVersion": "1.0.0",
  "sdkVersion": "1.0.0",
  "protocolVersion": "1.0.0",
  "pipeName": "autodesk-mcp-civil3d-12345",
  "pid": 12345,
  "startedUtc": "2026-08-07T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

The server never hardcodes pipe names. The monitor polls the registry every
`endpointsPollIntervalMs` and:

- supports **multiple bridges** (multiple Autodesk products, multiple instances of one product);
- removes **stale descriptors** (files whose pid is no longer a live process) on every poll;
- picks the **most recently started** endpoint after applying preferences
  (`preferredProduct`, then `preferredBridge`).

When the selected endpoint changes - including after the connected bridge restarts and
republishes - the manager disconnects the old session and connects to the new endpoint.

---

## Configuration

Precedence: **defaults -> configuration file -> environment variables**.

### Configuration file

Path is `--config <path>` / `-c <path>` on the command line, or the
`AUTODESK_MCP_CONFIG` environment variable. A malformed or missing file is ignored
(defaults apply).

```json
{
  "logLevel": "info",
  "endpointsDir": "C:\Users\you\AppData\Local\AutodeskMcp\endpoints",
  "preferredProduct": "Civil3D",
  "preferredBridge": "Civil3D.Bridge",
  "reconnectDelayMs": 1000,
  "maxReconnectAttempts": 10,
  "retryCooldownMs": 30000,
  "requestTimeoutMs": 30000,
  "heartbeatIntervalMs": 15000,
  "endpointsPollIntervalMs": 3000,
  "clientName": "Autodesk.MCP.Server",
  "clientVersion": "1.0.1"
}
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Overrides |
| --- | --- |
| `AUTODESK_MCP_LOG_LEVEL` | `logLevel` |
| `AUTODESK_MCP_ENDPOINTS_DIR` | `endpointsDir` |
| `AUTODESK_MCP_PREFERRED_PRODUCT` | `preferredProduct` |
| `AUTODESK_MCP_PREFERRED_BRIDGE` | `preferredBridge` |
| `AUTODESK_MCP_RECONNECT_DELAY_MS` | `reconnectDelayMs` |
| `AUTODESK_MCP_MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS` | `maxReconnectAttempts` |
| `AUTODESK_MCP_RETRY_COOLDOWN_MS` | `retryCooldownMs` |
| `AUTODESK_MCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | `requestTimeoutMs` |
| `AUTODESK_MCP_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` | `heartbeatIntervalMs` |
| `AUTODESK_MCP_ENDPOINTS_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `endpointsPollIntervalMs` |

### Option semantics

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reconnectDelayMs` | 1000 | Base delay before reconnecting; doubles after each failed attempt. |
| `maxReconnectAttempts` | 10 | Reconnect attempts in one burst before the endpoint is parked (`0` = keep retrying in the same burst). Parking is never terminal; discovery retries after `retryCooldownMs`. |
| `retryCooldownMs` | 30000 | How long a parked, still-registered endpoint is left alone before discovery retries it. |
| `requestTimeoutMs` | 30000 | Per-request timeout for bridge calls. |
| `heartbeatIntervalMs` | 15000 | `health/ping` interval (`0` disables the heartbeat). |
| `endpointsPollIntervalMs` | 3000 | Registry polling interval. |

## Logging

Logging uses **pino** and writes exclusively to **stderr** - stdout carries MCP JSON-RPC
traffic, so it must stay clean.

- `--logLevel` / `AUTODESK_MCP_LOG_LEVEL` selects `trace|debug|info|warn|error|fatal`.
- Every log line is structured JSON with a `component: "autodesk-mcp-server"` base and
  ISO timestamps.
- Instrumented events include: startup, endpoint selection, connect/reconnect attempts
  (with backoff), bridge disconnect, manifest loads, tool execution (correlation id and
  duration), cancellation forwarding, progress forwarding, and shutdown.

---

## Reconnect behavior

1. The monitor scans the registry on every poll and hands the manager the current endpoint
   set; the manager selects the best endpoint.
2. If the endpoint changed, the old session is closed (in-flight requests reject with
   `E_BRIDGE_UNAVAILABLE`) and a new connection is attempted.
3. Failed connects retry with exponential backoff (`reconnectDelayMs` doubling, capped at
   256x). A heartbeat failure or a dropped pipe also triggers the loop.
4. After `maxReconnectAttempts` failures the endpoint is **parked**, not abandoned: the
   manager returns to `discovering` and retries the same endpoint once `retryCooldownMs`
   has elapsed, for as long as it stays registered with a live process. There is no terminal
   state while the server is running, so a bridge that becomes reachable later is always
   picked up without restarting the server.
5. On connect, the manager performs the handshake and reloads the manifest, then emits
   `manifest`; the adapter updates `tools/list` and pushes `notifications/tools/list_changed`.
6. When no usable endpoint remains, the manager emits `manifestCleared`; the adapter drops the
   catalog and notifies the client, so `tools/list` never advertises tools that cannot run.

Because the manager is evaluated on every poll rather than only on registry changes, it also
recovers from a failed connection to an endpoint whose descriptor never changes — the case
that previously stranded the server after its retry budget ran out.

## Tool-list propagation

The server declares the `tools.listChanged` capability and sends
`notifications/tools/list_changed` whenever the visible catalog changes (bridge connected,
manifest refreshed after a reconnect, bridge lost). This is required, not optional: clients
such as VS Code call `tools/list` exactly once, immediately after `initialize`, which is
normally before any bridge has been discovered. Without the notification such a client would
display `0 tools` for the whole session.

The notification is suppressed when the catalog signature (tool names and versions) is
unchanged, so reconnecting to the same bridge does not churn the client. If the manifest
arrives before the client finishes initializing, the notification is replayed from
`oninitialized`.

---

## Client compatibility

- **MCP version:** the SDK server speaks the current MCP protocol (`initialize`,
  `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `ping`, `notifications/progress`, `notifications/cancelled`).
- **Dynamic discovery:** `tools/list` returns exactly the tools published by the connected
  bridge manifest, including their JSON Schema input schemas and annotations
  (`title`, `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`).
- **Confirmation:** bridge `E_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` failures are returned as structured
  results with a `confirmation.retryWith: { confirm: true }` field. Clients that support
  MCP elicitation can surface the confirmation; clients that do not can simply retry with
  the `confirm: true` argument. The `confirm` and `_meta` fields are stripped from tool
  arguments before validation and are never sent to the bridge as tool input.
- **Progress:** bridge `$/progress` notifications become MCP `notifications/progress`
  events addressed to the originating client's progress token.
- **Cancellation:** MCP `notifications/cancelled` becomes a bridge `$/cancel`
  notification for the matching correlation id.

## Building and testing

```bash
cd src/server/Autodesk.Mcp.Server
npm install          # or: node /tmp/npm/package/bin/npm-cli.js install
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run build        # tsc -p tsconfig.build.json -> dist/
npm test             # vitest run
```

The test suite (60 tests across 8 files) includes:

- **Unit tests** - SemVer parsing/formatting, NDJSON framing, endpoint-store parsing /
  selection / stale cleanup, ajv schema validation, manifest diffing.
- **Integration tests** - a protocol-faithful fake bridge listening on a real Windows
  named pipe verifies the full path: discovery -> handshake -> manifest loading -> routing ->
  execution -> protocol response, plus confirmation retry, progress forwarding, client
  cancellation, reconnect after bridge restart, and multi-instance selection.

## Running

```bash
node dist/index.js [--config <path>]
```

Requires the `Civil3D.Bridge` loaded inside a running Civil 3D session (which writes its
endpoint descriptor). MCP clients connect over stdio as usual.
