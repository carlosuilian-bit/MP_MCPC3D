# Autodesk MCP Platform

Let any MCP-compatible AI assistant read and edit **Autodesk Civil 3D** drawings
through tools - alignments, surfaces, corridors, pipe networks, quantity takeoff,
cut/fill and more.

```
AI client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Cline, ...)
        |  Model Context Protocol (stdio)
        v
Autodesk.MCP.Server   (TypeScript / Node.js - product-agnostic MCP server)
        |  JSON-RPC 2.0 over a local Windows named pipe
        v
Civil3D.Bridge        (C# / .NET 8 plugin loaded inside Civil 3D)
        |  Autodesk .NET API (in-process)
        v
Autodesk Civil 3D 2025 / 2026
```

- **No network**: everything runs on local named pipes, ACL'd to the current user.
- **Dynamic discovery**: the server learns the entire tool catalog from the bridge
  at handshake time - no tool is hardcoded, and future products plug in with zero
  server changes.
- **Safe editing**: editing tools run in transactions and require confirmation.

## Quick start

1. Install the **bridge**: copy the `Civil3D.Bridge.Bundle-<version>.bundle` folder
   from a release into `%APPDATA%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\` and restart Civil 3D.
   It loads automatically — `NETLOAD` is not part of normal use.
2. Install the **server**: `npm install -g autodesk-mcp-server` (or
   `npx -y autodesk-mcp-server@latest`).
3. Point your AI client at the server (ready-made configs in `examples/clients/`).

Civil 3D and your AI client can be started in any order, and either can be restarted
without touching the other: the server watches the endpoint registry continuously and
pushes tool-list updates as bridges come and go. See
[docs/Installation.md](docs/Installation.md#how-vs-code-connects-to-civil-3d) for the
full connection walkthrough, including how to diagnose "Discovered 0 tools".

See `docs/QuickStart.md` and `docs/Installation.md` for the full walkthrough.

## Examples

- `examples/clients/` - Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, Cline configurations
- `examples/config/` - server/bridge configs, env vars, logging, multi-bridge
- `examples/prompts/` - typical prompts by workflow
- `examples/workflows/` - end-to-end session transcripts
